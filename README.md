# Gates of Glory
A four man second year college project.

Gates of Glory is a 2.5D castle defense game where you build weapons and rooms to defend your castle from waves of enemies. 
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. 
To do that you have to build and upgrade weapons in and on top of your castle such as ballistas and canons.   
There are also four empty rooms where you can build four different types of rooms. 
For example a minion room to buy your own minions that fight against the enemies or an ambush room to unleash a rain of arrows/meteors/spears from above.  
There's also a shop where you can buy traps to place on the ground such as spikes which damage enemies or a patch of oil which slows enemies.
